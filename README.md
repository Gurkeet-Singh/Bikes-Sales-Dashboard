## Insights

The following insights were gained from analyzing the data:

- Gender: There were 489 females and 511 males who purchased a bike.
- Age Bracket: Customers were divided into three age brackets: adolescent, middle age, and old age. Those less than 31 were considered adolescents, those less than 54 were considered middle age, and the rest were considered old age.
- Children: Customers with no children had a greater chance of purchasing a bike.

## Recommendations

Based on the insights gained from analyzing the data, the following recommendations are made:
- Target advertising towards middle-aged customers as they make up the majority of bike purchases.
- Focus on marketing to individuals who do not have children, as they are more likely to purchase a bike.
- Offer promotions for customers who have longer commutes to work to encourage them to purchase a bike for transportation.
- Consider offering financing options for customers who may not have the full amount to purchase a bike outright.
